# Terrathon
This repository contains the implementation of ideas in a hackathon .
Terrathon - a hackathon which was conducted on the theme "sustaiable development".

## Project domain - Sustainable development in the Health care system 

Our vision was to improve health industry especially government hospitals .These government hospitals  are suffering from a  lot of problems which are  unaddressed and hence by solving few of these problems we ensure healthy society.
### Problems in the government hospitals - 
1. Improper storage/Management of patient’s health record
2. Unorganized referral system 
3. Quality and quantity of medicine 
4. Telemedicine in rural areas
5. Bed management 
6. Managing the patient loads / improper appointments  

### Solutions -

1.  Hospitals don’t keep track of patients record and its an unmet need which could be solved by keeping track of patients record as a timeline which would be linked to  Aadhar so that any government hospital could access the record when he visits .
2. Sometimes when  patients visit a hospital , the doctors aren’t qualified enough or they won’t have proper infrastructure to cure the problem and hence are referred to a higher hospital and all the checkups are done again which is redundant and this could be solved by connecting the higher hospital’s (a patient being referred from a local to district hospital ) doctors to all other  hospitals in that district make the patients record available the referred doctor to do the further needful.(creating an online-referral system)
3. In the government hospitals only few types of medicines are present and the root cause of this issue is CMO, who just purchases those medicine which gets him commission and this can be solved by creating a portal for buying medicines  where a certain number of predefined units of all types of medicine has to be bought and this also brings in transparency in the system .
4. Many a times when patients are required to go to hospitals which are very far from their locality and in such situations some patients can’t afford to go(patient might be called for a review after the checkup and traveling far places just for review isn’t feasible for patients) and this could be solved by implementing a small booths(which has a computer and an operator to operate it ) in rural localities where they could connect with the doctors for video conference.
5. Lack of up-to-date information of hospitals beds, specifically in emergencies, is a significant problem this could be solved by keeping track of beds and prediction(for how long the bed might be held occupied which would be predicted by doctor) of availability of already occupuid beds.
6. Government hospitals are prone to unmanageable patient loads this could be solved by maintaining a proper appointment system.



Out of these we implemented the solutions for Managing patients record , referral system and managing patients load.

## Major implementation in our MERN app 
1. E referral system
2. Maintain & track Patients medical history via Aadhar number
3. ML model which predicts the medicines for minor illness (Naive Bayes classifier)
4. Auto recommendation of medicines 
5. Speech to text conversion to help doctors improve efficiency
