# Diseaseprediction

Disease prediction from symptoms.

	1.To save the time for initial process of diagnosis symptoms, this model 
	proposes an automated disease prediction sysem that relies on user input.
	2.The system takes input from user and provides a list of probable diseases.
	3.Disease will be predicted using Naive Bayesian algorithm which works on probabilistic approach
	more specifically Multinomial NB since multiple symptoms are taken.  
	4.According to literature survey, this algorithm results in maximum accuracy for larger dataset.
	5.The dataset contains disease as labels and for each disease symptoms are given.
